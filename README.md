# Image Steganography

This Python script allows you to hide text messages within images using steganography techniques. You can encode a text message into an image and later decode it to retrieve the hidden message.

## Usage

1. **Encode the Image**: Run the script and choose option 1. You will be prompted to provide the path to the image file you want to encode. Then, enter the text message you want to hide. Finally, specify the path where the encoded image should be saved.

2. **Decode the Image**: Run the script and choose option 2. Provide the path to the encoded image file. The script will extract the hidden message and display it.
